# Movie Genres
A simple implementation of CRUD Operations where the user can interact with an array of movie genres.

## Getting Started
The idea behind this project was practice with the modules **express** to handle HTTP Requests and **joi** to handle simple validation. It was also my first experience with **nodejs**

## Database
To make the project simple and focus in the modules listed in *Getting Started*, no Database was used. The CRUD Operations are applied in an array of the movie genres.

## Tests
In order to make simple validations, and see if the application has worked as expected, i've used the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to make the HTTP requests. The file **HTTPRequests.json** has all the requests that i've created, user just have to import it.

## Running
    node src/app.js
